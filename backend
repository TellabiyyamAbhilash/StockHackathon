**You:**

I want to implement the Backend work on my project, which is a stock exchange project. I want this to be implemented on the Python Django framework. Give me the steps to start the project and prerequisites.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here are the general steps to start a new Django project for a stock exchange application:
Prerequisites:
* Python (preferably version 3.6 or above)* Pip (Python package manager)* Django (install using pip)Steps:
1. Create a new directory for your Django project and navigate to it using the command line.
2. Create a virtual environment for your project using the command `python -m venv env` (you can replace `env` with any name you prefer).
3. Activate the virtual environment using the command `source env/bin/activate` (if you're using Windows, use the command `env\Scripts\activate` instead).
4. Install Django using pip: `pip install django`.
5. Create a new Django project using the command `django-admin startproject projectname` (replace `projectname` with your preferred name for the project).
6. Create a new Django app within your project using the command `python manage.py startapp appname` (replace `appname` with your preferred name for the app).
7. Define the models for your stock exchange application within your app's `models.py` file. This will define the database structure for your application.
8. Define the views for your application within your app's `views.py` file. Views are responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses.
9. Define the URLs for your application within your project's `urls.py` file. This maps URLs to the appropriate view functions.
10. Define the templates for your application within your app's `templates` directory. Templates are responsible for generating HTML that will be returned as part of the HTTP response.
11. Set up your database by running the command `python manage.py migrate`. This will create the necessary tables in your database.
12. Start the development server using the command `python manage.py runserver`. This will start a local web server where you can view and test your application.
These are the basic steps to get started with a Django project for a stock exchange application. Of course, there are many other details and considerations that go into building a complete and secure application, so it's important to do further research and follow best practices in your development process.

**You:**

i have a database in mongdb compass. How to make use of this database 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To use MongoDB Compass database in your Python Django project, you need to follow these steps:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djongo',
        'NAME': 'your_database_name',
        'CLIENT': {
            'host': 'your_mongodb_host',
            'port': your_mongodb_port,
        },
    }
}

```
Replace `your_database_name` with the name of your MongoDB database, and replace `your_mongodb_host` and `your_mongodb_port` with the hostname and port number of your MongoDB server.
1. In your Django app's `models.py` file, define the models that correspond to the collections in your MongoDB database. Use the `django.db.models` classes and fields as usual, but use the `EmbeddedModelField` and `ArrayModelField` fields from `djongo.models.fields` to represent embedded documents and arrays respectively.
```python
from djongo import models

class MyMongoCollection(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    description = models.TextField()
    author = models.EmbeddedModelField(
        model_container=Author,
    )
    comments = models.ArrayModelField(
        model_container=Comment,
    )

```
1. You can then use the Django ORM to query and manipulate the data in your MongoDB database. For example, to retrieve all objects from the `MyMongoCollection` collection, you can use:
```python
from myapp.models import MyMongoCollection

my_objects = MyMongoCollection.objects.all()

```
These are the basic steps to use a MongoDB database in a Python Django project using MongoDB Compass. However, you should also be familiar with the MongoDB query language and best practices for database design and indexing in order to optimize the performance of your application.


------------------

**You:**

Now i want to define the models for my project.
model for users login(can use the django usermanager). 
This model should have the necessary fields for storing the user details like username, password, 
fullname, lastname, avilable margin,used margin, available cash.
This model itself is used for google login for JWT token authentication of the user 
also make this noted and give me the absolute model 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here is an example of a Django model that defines the fields you mentioned for a user login with Google authentication and JWT token:
```python
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, BaseUserManager, PermissionsMixin

class MyUserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('The Email field must be set')
        email = self.normalize_email(email)
        user = self.model(email=email, **extra_fields)
        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password=None, **extra_fields):
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_staff', True)
        extra_fields.setdefault('is_superuser', True)
        return self.create_user(email, password, **extra_fields)

class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)
    fullname = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    lastname = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    available_margin = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    used_margin = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    available_cash = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    is_staff = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    date_joined = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'

    objects = MyUserManager()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email

```
This model extends `AbstractBaseUser` and `PermissionsMixin`, which are built-in Django classes for user authentication and permission management. The `MyUserManager` class defines the user creation methods that are called by the Django authentication framework. The `User` class defines the fields you mentioned and some additional fields such as `is_active`, `is_staff`, and `date_joined`. These fields are used by the authentication and permission systems to determine whether a user is allowed to perform certain actions.
Note that this is just an example and you may need to modify the fields or methods depending on your specific requirements. You will also need to run the command `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to create the database tables for this model.


------------------

**You:**

'djongo' isn't an available database backend or couldn't be imported. Check the above exception. To use one of the built-in backends, use 'django.db.backends.XXX', where XXX is one of:
    'mysql', 'oracle', 'postgresql', 'sqlite3. This is the error while doing makemigrations

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

The error message suggests that Django cannot find the `djongo` database backend. This can happen if you have not installed the `djongo` package correctly or if you have not added it to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in your Django project's settings file.
Here are some steps to troubleshoot this issue:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'djongo',
    # ...
]

```


------------------

**You:**

write the code for 
1. signup : using gmail
2. login : using gmail and 6 digit otp sent to username which is email

this should also include the jwt token authentication after the login.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here is an example implementation of sign up and login using Gmail for Django project with JWT authentication:
```python
import jwt
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from django.conf import settings
from django.contrib.auth import authenticate, get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.http import JsonResponse
from django.views.decorators.csrf import csrf_exempt
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response

User = get_user_model()

# Sign up view
@csrf_exempt
@api_view(['POST'])
def signup(request):
    email = request.POST.get('email')
    fullname = request.POST.get('fullname')
    lastname = request.POST.get('lastname')
    password = request.POST.get('password')
    confirm_password = request.POST.get('confirm_password')

    if not email or not fullname or not lastname or not password or not confirm_password:
        return Response({'error': 'All fields are required'})

    if password != confirm_password:
        return Response({'error': 'Passwords do not match'})

    try:
        # Check if user already exists
        user = User.objects.get(email=email)
        return Response({'error': 'User already exists'})
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        # Create new user
        user = User.objects.create_user(email=email, fullname=fullname, lastname=lastname, password=password)
        return Response({'success': 'User created successfully'})

# Login view
@csrf_exempt
@api_view(['POST'])
def login(request):
    email = request.POST.get('email')
    otp = request.POST.get('otp')

    if not email or not otp:
        return Response({'error': 'Email and OTP are required'})

    try:
        user = User.objects.get(email=email)
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        return Response({'error': 'User does not exist'})

    # Check if OTP is valid
    if str(user.id) not in request.session or str(request.session[user.id]) != otp:
        return Response({'error': 'Invalid OTP'})

    # Delete OTP from session
    del request.session[user.id]

    # Generate JWT token
    token = jwt.encode({
        'id': user.id,
        'exp': datetime.utcnow() + timedelta(minutes=30)
    }, settings.SECRET_KEY, algorithm='HS256')

    return Response({'token': token})

# Send OTP view
@csrf_exempt
@api_view(['POST'])
def send_otp(request):
    email = request.POST.get('email')

    if not email:
        return Response({'error': 'Email is required'})

    try:
        user = User.objects.get(email=email)
    except User.DoesNotExist:
        return Response({'error': 'User does not exist'})

    # Generate random 6-digit OTP
    otp = ''.join([str(random.randint(0, 9)) for _ in range(6)])

    # Store OTP in session
    request.session[user.id] = otp

    # Send OTP to user's email
    send_mail(
        'Login OTP',
        f'Your OTP for login is {otp}',
        'from@example.com',
        [email],
        fail_silently=False,
    )

    return Response({'success': 'OTP sent'})

```
In this example, the `signup` view creates a new user with a Gmail email address, fullname, lastname, and password. The `login` view checks the email address and OTP entered by the user and generates a JWT token if they are valid. The `send_otp` view sends a 6-digit OTP to the user's email address and stores it in the session.
To use this code, you will need to add these views to your Django project's `urls.py` file and configure


------------------

**You:**

add the urls for these two views in urls.py

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here's an example of how you can add the URLs for the `signup` and `login` views to your Django project's `urls.py` file:
```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import signup, login

urlpatterns = [
    path('signup/', signup, name='signup'),
    path('login/', login, name='login'),
]

```
You can include this file in your Django project's `urls.py` file by adding:
```python
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    # Other URL patterns...
    path('api/', include('yourapp.urls')),
]

```
where `yourapp` is the name of your Django app. With this configuration, the URLs for the `signup` and `login` views will be accessible at `/api/signup/` and `/api/login/` respectively.


------------------

**You:**

give me all the dependencies to be installed which are used in the signup and login views.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here are the dependencies you would need to install to use the code for the `signup` and `login` views:
You can install all of these dependencies using `pip`. Note that you might need to run `pip` with elevated privileges depending on your system configuration.

TypeError: UserManager.create_user() missing 1 required positional argument: 'username'

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

The `TypeError` you're seeing is likely because you're not passing the `username` argument to the `create_user` method of the `UserManager`. The `create_user` method requires two arguments: `username` and `password`, but you're only passing the `password` argument.
To fix this error, you should modify the `signup` view to pass the `username` argument to the `create_user` method. Here's an example of how you can modify the `signup` view:
```python
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework import status
import random
from google.oauth2 import id_token
from google.auth.transport import requests

User = get_user_model()

@api_view(['POST'])
def signup(request):
    id_token = request.data.get('id_token')
    try:
        # Specify the CLIENT_ID of the app that accesses the backend:
        idinfo = id_token.verify_oauth2_token(id_token, requests.Request(), "YOUR_CLIENT_ID")

        if idinfo['iss'] not in ['accounts.google.com', 'https://accounts.google.com']:
            raise ValueError('Wrong issuer.')

        # ID token is valid. Get the user's Google Account ID from the decoded token.
        user_id = idinfo['sub']
        email = idinfo['email']
        name = idinfo['name']
    except ValueError:
        # Invalid token
        pass

    # create user
    try:
        # create a random 6 digit OTP
        otp = random.randint(100000, 999999)

        # hash the password
        password = make_password(otp)

        # create the user
        user = User.objects.create_user(email, password=password, full_name=name)

        # set the user's additional fields
        user.last_name = name.split()[-1]
        user.available_margin = 100000
        user.used_margin = 0
        user.available_cash = 100000

        # save the user
        user.save()

        # return the response
        return Response({'success': True, 'message': 'User created successfully.', 'user_id': user.id})

    except Exception as e:
        return Response({'success': False, 'message': str(e)}, status=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST)

```
In this modified version of the `signup` view, the `email` field is used as the `username` argument to the `create_user` method. This should resolve the `TypeError` you're seeing.

django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency stockapis.0001_initial on database 'default'.

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

The error message you're seeing indicates that there is an inconsistency in the migration history of your database. Specifically, it's saying that the `admin.0001_initial` migration was applied before its dependency `stockapis.0001_initial` on the `default` database.
This error can occur when the migration history of your database is not in sync with your project's migration files. It can also occur if you've deleted or renamed a migration file and then tried to apply a migration that depends on it.
To fix this error, you can try the following steps:
After running these commands, you should be able to run your migrations without encountering the `InconsistentMigrationHistory` error.


------------------

**You:**

Actually i deleted the before migrations. what should i do now

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If you deleted the migration files that were applied to your database, then you will need to recreate those migration files to bring your database back into sync with your Django project.
To recreate the deleted migration files, you can follow these steps:
After following these steps, your database should be back in sync with your Django project and you should be able to continue developing your application.


------------------

**You:**

cant i deleted the migrations history and start the migrations from fresh

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Yes, you can delete the migration history for your app and start fresh with a new set of migrations. However, be aware that this will delete all of the migration history for your app and you will need to recreate your migrations from scratch.
To delete the migration history for your app and start fresh, you can follow these steps:
Note that deleting the migration history for your app can be a risky operation, especially if you have a production database with important data. Be sure to make a backup of your database before proceeding.


------------------

**You:**

will the migrations get deleted by dropping the database

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Dropping the database will delete all the data stored in the database, including the migration history. When you create a new database and run migrations again, Django will create a new migration history table and start recording migrations from scratch.
However, dropping the database should only be done in situations where you don't need any of the data stored in the database, as it will result in permanent data loss. If you have important data in the database that you want to preserve, you should instead use Django's built-in migration tools to manage the database schema changes.
In general, it's a good practice to keep backups of your database so that you can restore it in case of data loss.


------------------

**You:**

then give me the steps to drop the database 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To drop a database using Django, you can use the `flush` command with the `--database` option to specify the name of the database you want to drop.
Be sure to make a backup of your database before proceeding, as dropping the database will result in permanent data loss.
Here are the steps to drop a database in Django:
Note that dropping the database will delete all data in the database, including tables, views, stored procedures, functions, and data. Be sure to make a backup of your database before proceeding, as dropping the database will result in permanent data loss.

django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency trade.0001_initial on database 'default'. 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

The error message "django.db.migrations.exceptions.InconsistentMigrationHistory: Migration admin.0001_initial is applied before its dependency trade.0001_initial on database 'default'" indicates that there is an inconsistency in the migration history of your Django project.
This error occurs when Django is unable to determine the correct order of applying migrations because one migration has been applied before its dependency. In your case, it seems that the `admin` app's initial migration (`admin.0001_initial`) was applied before the `trade` app's initial migration (`trade.0001_initial`), which is causing the inconsistency.
To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:
After completing any of the above steps, you should be able to run migrations without any errors.

**You:**

where is the jwt is getting stored ?? 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

When a user logs in using JWT authentication, the JWT token is generated by the server and sent back to the client as a response. By default, the JWT token is stored in the client-side browser's `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.
`localStorage` stores the data with no expiration date, while `sessionStorage` stores the data for one session (the data is lost when the browser tab is closed).
In Django, you can configure the JWT token settings in your `settings.py` file. For example, you can set the `JWT_AUTH_COOKIE` variable to store the token in a cookie instead of `localStorage`:
```python
JWT_AUTH = {
    'JWT_AUTH_COOKIE': 'my-app-token',
}

```
This will store the JWT token in a cookie named `my-app-token` instead of `localStorage`. You can also set other JWT-related settings in this configuration dictionary, such as the token expiration time, token authentication backend, and more.


------------------

**You:**

i want to check the token is valid or not for the apis ? how should i do that 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To check if a JWT token is valid or not for the APIs in Django, you can use the `jwt_decode_handler` function from the `rest_framework_jwt.utils` module.
Here's an example of how you can check if a token is valid or not:
```python
from rest_framework_jwt.utils import jwt_decode_handler
from rest_framework_jwt.authentication import JSONWebTokenAuthentication

# Get the token from the request headers or cookies
token = request.META.get('HTTP_AUTHORIZATION', '').split(' ')[1]  # or request.COOKIES.get('my-app-token')

try:
    # Decode the token and get the user information
    user_info = jwt_decode_handler(token)
    
    # Check if the token is valid and not expired
    JSONWebTokenAuthentication().authenticate_credentials(token)
    
    # Token is valid
    print('Token is valid!')
    # Access user info using user_info dictionary
    # ...
    
except Exception as e:
    # Token is invalid or expired
    print('Token is invalid or expired:', str(e))
    # Handle the error or return an error response
    # ...

```
This code gets the token from the request headers or cookies, decodes it using `jwt_decode_handler`, and then checks if the token is valid and not expired using `JSONWebTokenAuthentication().authenticate_credentials(token)`. If the token is valid, you can access the user information from the `user_info` dictionary. If the token is invalid or expired, you can handle the error or return an error response.


------------------

**You:**

is this actually usefull checking the token valid or not while being in the session

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If you are using sessions in your Django application, then you don't need to manually check the validity of JWT tokens for each request. Instead, you can use the built-in session authentication provided by Django.
When a user logs in to your application using their username and password, Django creates a session for the user and stores the session ID in a cookie on the user's browser. For each subsequent request, the session ID is sent along with the request, and Django uses the session ID to retrieve the user's session data from the database.
To use session authentication in your Django application, you need to enable it in your `settings.py` file:
```python
# settings.py
...
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ],
}

```
Once you have enabled session authentication, you can use the `@login_required` decorator on your views to require authentication for specific views. If a user is not logged in, they will be redirected to the login page.
Here's an example of how you can use `@login_required` in your views:
```python
from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
from django.shortcuts import render

@login_required
def my_view(request):
    # This view requires authentication
    # ...

```
Note that session authentication is different from JWT authentication, and you cannot use JWT tokens to authenticate with Django sessions. If you want to use JWT authentication in your application, you need to manually check the validity of the tokens for each request, as I explained in my previous answer.


------------------

**You:**

then i want to make  login required for using the apis with this jwt token 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To make authentication required for using the APIs in your Django application with JWT tokens, you can use the `IsAuthenticated` permission class provided by Django REST framework.
Here's an example of how you can use the `IsAuthenticated` permission class in your views:
```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view, permission_classes
from rest_framework.response import Response

@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def my_view(request):
    # This view requires authentication
    # ...

```
In this example, the `IsAuthenticated` permission class is used to require authentication for the `my_view` function-based view. The `@permission_classes` decorator is used to apply the permission class to the view.
When a user makes a request to this view with a valid JWT token, they will be granted access to the view. If the user is not authenticated, they will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
Note that you should also include the `AuthenticationMiddleware` in your Django application's middleware settings to ensure that the JWT token is properly authenticated. Here's an example of how you can include the `AuthenticationMiddleware` in your `settings.py` file:
```python
# settings.py
...
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware',
    # ...
]

```
With the `AuthenticationMiddleware` included in your middleware settings, the JWT token will be authenticated and the user will be authenticated for the API views decorated with `@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])`.


------------------

**You:**

how to add the restframework in settings 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To add Django REST framework to your Django project, you need to make the following changes in your `settings.py` file:
1. Add `rest_framework` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ...
    'rest_framework',
    # ...
]

```
1. Set the `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` setting to include the JWT token authentication class:
```python
# settings.py

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ],
    # ...
}

```
With these changes, Django REST framework will be installed and JWT token authentication will be enabled for your APIs.

**You:**

i want to use serializers to parse the data. give me the sample model for stock details and a serializer for it

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure! Here is an example model for stock details and its corresponding serializer:
```python
# models.py

from django.db import models

class Stock(models.Model):
    symbol = models.CharField(max_length=10)
    company_name = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    last_price = models.FloatField()
    change = models.FloatField()
    percent_change = models.FloatField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.symbol

```
```python
# serializers.py

from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Stock

class StockSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Stock
        fields = '__all__'

```
In this example, the `Stock` model has five fields: `symbol`, `company_name`, `last_price`, `change`, and `percent_change`. The `StockSerializer` uses the `ModelSerializer` class provided by Django REST framework to automatically generate a serializer for the `Stock` model. The `fields = '__all__'` option specifies that all fields in the model should be included in the serialized representation.

**You:**

write a code for listing all the records of a table using the listapi from restframework

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here is an example code for listing all the records of a table using the `ListAPIView` from Django REST framework:
```python
# views.py

from rest_framework import generics
from .models import Stock
from .serializers import StockSerializer

class StockList(generics.ListAPIView):
    queryset = Stock.objects.all()
    serializer_class = StockSerializer

```
In this example, the `StockList` class defines a `ListAPIView` that lists all the records in the `Stock` table. The `queryset` attribute specifies the list of objects that should be displayed, which is set to `Stock.objects.all()` to display all records. The `serializer_class` attribute specifies the serializer class to use for the response, which is set to `StockSerializer` to serialize the data.
You can then add a URL pattern to your `urls.py` file to map a URL to this view. For example:
```python
# urls.py

from django.urls import path
from .views import StockList

urlpatterns = [
    path('stocks/', StockList.as_view(), name='stock-list'),
]

```
This URL pattern maps the URL `/stocks/` to the `StockList` view. When this URL is accessed, the view will list all the records in the `Stock` table using the `StockSerializer` serializer.

give me the work process of jwt token.
In my case, the jwt token is getting generated but the apis with permission classes and authentication classes are not working


------------------

**ChatGPT:**

Sure, here is a high-level overview of the work process of JWT token authentication in Django:
In your case, if the JWT token is getting generated but the APIs with permission and authentication classes are not working, there could be a few possible reasons:
By debugging the above possible reasons, you should be able to identify the issue and resolve it.


------------------

**You:**

what should be the settings code to solve all these issues correctly 

------------------

**ChatGPT:**

To solve issues related to JWT authentication and permission classes, you can use the following settings in your Django project:
```python
# settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other installed apps
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_framework_simplejwt.token_blacklist',
]

REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication',
    ),
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': (
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ),
}

SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=60),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True,
    'BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION': True,
    'ALGORITHM': 'HS256',
    'SIGNING_KEY': SECRET_KEY,
    'VERIFYING_KEY': None,
    'AUTH_HEADER_TYPES': ('Bearer',),
    'USER_ID_FIELD': 'id',
    'USER_ID_CLAIM': 'user_id',
    'AUTH_TOKEN_CLASSES': ('rest_framework_simplejwt.tokens.AccessToken',),
    'TOKEN_TYPE_CLAIM': 'token_type',
}


```
In this code snippet, we have included the `rest_framework` and `rest_framework_simplejwt` modules in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list. We have also set the `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES` to use the JWT token authentication provided by `rest_framework_simplejwt` and `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES` to use the `IsAuthenticated` permission class for API views.
We have also set the `SIMPLE_JWT` configuration settings to set the token lifetimes, algorithm, signing key, and other options related to JWT authentication.
With these settings, you should be able to authenticate users using JWT tokens and restrict access to API views based on the user's authentication status.

This isn't working for the apis which doesn't have any permission classes


------------------

**ChatGPT:**

If the APIs don't have any permission classes specified, then they will be accessible to everyone regardless of whether they are authenticated or not. To restrict access to only authenticated users, you can add a default permission class in the Django REST Framework settings.
To do this, add the following code in your Django project's settings.py file:
```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ],
}

```
This will set the default permission class for all APIs to `IsAuthenticated`, which means that the user must be authenticated to access any APIs that don't have any other permission classes specified.
If you want to allow anonymous access to certain APIs, you can specify the `AllowAny` permission class for those APIs explicitly. For example:
```python
from rest_framework.permissions import AllowAny

class MyAPIView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [AllowAny, ]
    # ... view code here ...

```
This will allow anonymous access to the `MyAPIView` API.
